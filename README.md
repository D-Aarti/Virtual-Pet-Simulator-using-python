# Virtual-Pet-Simulator-using-python
##Objective:
Develop a Virtual Pet Simulator using fundamental programming concepts such as
functions, loops, conditionals, and dictionaries. The simulator will allow users to interact
with a virtual pet by feeding it, playing with it, and monitoring its key attributes such as
happiness and hunger levels. The solution aims to provide an engaging and interactive
experience while reinforcing core programming skills through the implementation of
logical structures and data manipulation.

##Requirements:
This section lists the tools, technologies, and any prerequisites needed to run the project.
Example:
• Python 3.x installed
• Basic knowledge of Python programming
• Code editor Python IDLE
• Terminal/Command prompt to run the script.

##Functionality / Features
Briefly describe what the program does and the features it includes.
Example:
• Feed the pet to reduce hunger level
• Play with the pet to increase happiness level
• Display the current status of the pet
• Continuous loop to interact until the user exits
• Alerts when hunger or happiness levels become critical

##Conclusion:
Summarize what was achieved in the project.
Example:
This Virtual Pet Simulator successfully demonstrates user interaction through input/output
handling, use of functions for code organization, and conditionals to control the game flow.
It serves as a good foundation for learning more complex programming concepts.
